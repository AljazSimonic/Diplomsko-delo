# Saving and loading the POVME points of the pocket-encompassing region.

							   # imagine, identifying just the right set
							   # of inclusion and exclusion spheres and
							   # boxes to encompass the binding pocket
							   # is challenging. One approach is to
							   # define an initial geometry, visualize
							   # that geometry together with the protein
							   # using a program like VMD, and then
							   # iteratively add new inclusion and
							   # exclusion regions as required. The
							   # ability to save the points for
							   # visualization is helpful. Additionally,
                                                           # if your point field contains many
							   # points, generating the field may be
							   # computationally intensive. If you want
							   # to use the same field for multiple
							   # POVME runs, using a saved copy of the
							   # field rather than repeatedly generating
							   # it from scratch is more efficient. Note
							   # that POVME also saves a NPY file, which
							   # contains the same data as the PDB file
							   # but can be loaded much faster in
							   # subsequent POVME runs. The point-field
							   # PDB file is saved to
							   # {PREFIX}point_field.pdb (see
							   # OutputFilenamePrefix below).

							   # Additionally, if you specify a
							   # contiguous-pocket seed region (see
							   # ContiguousPocketSeedSphere and
							   # ContiguousPocketSeedBox below), POVME
							   # will also save those points to
							   # {PREFIX}contiguous_pocket_seed_points.pdb
